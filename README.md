# Dotfiles? What's that?
Dotfiles are files that configure a system to a user's liking. In this case, it configures the OS, homedir, packages, disk partitions, and anything else I can with NixOS and home-manager.

# How do you choose your hostnames?
I choose them from my favorite anime characters.
 - Yuki (Laptop): [Yuki Suou](https://anilist.co/character/243404/Yuki-Suou), A cute but chaotic one that made twitter spit their beverages a few times. No real connection with my laptop.
 - Futaba (Hetzner box): [Rio Futaba](https://anilist.co/character/88748/Megumi-Katou), A quiet eccentric that is knowlegable about things. Used on my main server with all it's services.
